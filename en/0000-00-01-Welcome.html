<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>Alice and I decided to make this website as a way to thank you for your presence in our lives and on our wedding day. We also would like to make this virtual space a “meeting point”, an instrument to shorten the distance among us...</p>
<p>Well, “nosso grande dia” (“our great day”) refers to our wedding day. Better would be to say our great days and not only because we had two weddings, but also because we believe that a happy story is not made of one or two memorable days!<br> It’s not made of only two people either. You are an important part of our story and our happiness, so enjoy yourself here, interact with this website, feel welcome!</p>
