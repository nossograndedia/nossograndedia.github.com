<p>Exactly one week after the ceremony in London, approximately 9700km on the other side of the world, São José do Rio Pardo -Alice's home town- was the place for our second big day. It was so nice to see our family and so many friends gathered together there.</p> <p>The ceremony started, according to Brazilian tradition, in the evening and lasted till the early morning... We can't find words to thank everyone who made it possible to be there for us because without you we wouldn't have a special day of celebration, as celebration is only possible when we have who we love around.<br /> But we do understand that Brazil is a bit far away for many of our  family and friends... For the ones who couldn't be there, we would still like to share those special moments with you, so enjoy the <a href="#pictures">pictures</a> and the <a href="#video">video</a>.</p>
